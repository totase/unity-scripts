# ðŸ“š Unity scripts

A collection of various scripts I've used across the many Unity projects I've started. Many of them are used frequently for quick prototyping, so I'm storing them here for easy access.

### Level generation

I have a separate repo with examples of level generation, which includes scripts and example scenes. [Find it here](https://github.com/totase/level-generation).

Scripts may include sub-optimal code. Use at your own risk!
