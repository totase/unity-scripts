# 📚 Unity scripts

A collection of various scripts I've used across the many Unity projects I've started. Many of them are used frequently for quick prototyping, so I'm storing them here for easy access.

## 💁‍♂️ Disclaimer

I am by no means very proficient in C#, so scripts may include sub-optimal code. Use at your own risk!
