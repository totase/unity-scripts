# ðŸ“š Unity scripts

A collection of various scripts I've used across the many Unity projects I've started. Many of them are used frequently for quick prototyping, so I'm storing them here for easy access. Scripts included are specifically made and used for 2D development.

### Level generation

I have a separate repo with examples of level generation, which includes scripts and example scenes. [Find it here](https://github.com/totase/level-generation).

## Disclaimer

Some of these scripts have been lying around for years, so they may include sub-optimal code.
